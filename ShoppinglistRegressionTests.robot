Reset And Close Shoppinglist
        # Before closing the browers, it would be good to reset the
        # shopping list contents back to its original contents of
        # Milk, Eggs and Bread by adding Bread. Since adding an item
        # is a part of Assignment 2, it is not done here. You can
        # edit your own version of this script to have the adding done.
